The Router Gear
================================================================================
**Laravel Router Standalone**

Okay so by now hopefully you have heard of [Laravel](http://laravel.com/),
the PHP framework that just makes things easy. So first things first full credit
goes to [Taylor Otwell](https://github.com/taylorotwell) for the Router API.

How to Install
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation via composer is easy:

	composer require gears/router:*

How to Use
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In your *legacy* - non Laravel application.
You can use the Laravel Router API like so:

```php
// Make sure you have composer included
require('vendor/autoload.php');

// Install the gears router component
Gears\Router::install('/file/path/to/my/routes');

// At this point execution will not continue. The router will either return
// the output from a route and exit or it will output a 404 and then exit.
```

The ```/file/path/to/my/routes``` can either be a routes php file.
eg: ```/file/path/to/my/routes.php``` this file would look just like any
*routes.php* file you would find in any other Laravel App.

**OR**

The path can be to a folder containing lots of route files. The files will be
included automatically for you and added to the router. This is my prefered 
solution.

> A little aside: In my Laravel Apps I place some code, similar to what is in
> this Router that loops through a *routes* folder inside my *app* dir.
> I place one route definition per file. I rarely use Controllers.
> I name each route file like *search-{postcode}.GET.php* which contains:
> ```Route::get('/search/{postcode}', function($postcode){});```
> It makes for a very fast prototyping development life cycle.

An Example Route
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So just like a Laravel Route, see: http://laravel.com/docs/routing
Here is an example route file.

```php
Route::get('/', function()
{
	return 'I Am Groot';
});
```

The 404 Error
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Out of the box we have built in a simple and clean looking 404 error page.
Credits go to: http://html5boilerplate.com/ Thank Guys.

However if you wish to overide the 404 content the router returns.
The instalation of the router might look like:

```php
Gears\Router::install('/file/path/to/my/routes', 'Custom 404 HTML');
```

Exit On Complete
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For most setups you will probably want the execution of PHP to stop after the
router has done it's thing and sent the response. However if for whatever
reason you don't want this, perhaps some sort of output buffering or something.
The instalation of the router might look like:

```php
Gears\Router::install('/file/path/to/my/routes', 'Custom 404 HTML', false);
```

More info
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For more configuration options see the class comments at:

So now for the why?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
While laravel is so awesomely cool and great. If you want to pull a feature out
and use it in another project it can become difficult. Firstly you have to have
an innate understanding of the [IoC Container](http://laravel.com/docs/ioc).

You then find that this class needs that class which then requires some other
config variable that is normally present in the IoC when run inside a normal
Laravel App but in your case you haven't defined it and don't really want
to define that value because it makes no sense in your lets say *legacy*
application.

Perfect example is when I tried to pull the session API out to use in wordpress.
It wanted to know about a ```booted``` method, which I think comes from
```Illuminate\Foundation\Application```. At this point in time I already had to
add various other things into the IoC to make it happy and it was the last straw
that broke the camels back, I chucked a coders tantrum, walked to the fridge,
grabbed another Redbull and sat back down with a new approach.

The result is this project.
